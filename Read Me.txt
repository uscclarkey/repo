Hi And welcome to Mikey1234 

1 2 3 Easy Repo

FIRSTLY GET FAMILIAR WITH THE FOLDERISATION OF EVERYTHING I WOULD MAKE 2 COPIES 

1. WHICH IS YOURS
2. WHICH IS IS ORIGINAL 

THAT IS SO YOU CAN COMPARE JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING SETUP CORRECTLY
ONCE SETUP YOU CAN DELETE THE ORIGINAL FOLDER !!!

what you need to change in this repo obviously is everything called "YourRepo"

inside the repository.YourRepo is an addon xml

you need to change the "CHANGEME" to your dropbox account puplic number !!

and the "HELLO" TO YOUR NAME

also you will need to edit the addon.xml to your liking !

this is what it looks like

<addon id="repository.YourRepo" name="HELLO REPO" version="1.0" provider-name="HELLO Your Name"> 
	<extension point="xbmc.addon.repository" name="HELLO Addon Repository">                     <------------change the CHANGEME
		<info compressed="false">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/CHANGEME/My-Repo/addons.xml</info>    <------------change the CHANGEME
		<checksum>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/CHANGEME/Your-Repo/addons.xml.md5</checksum>         <------------change the CHANGEME
		<datadir zip="true">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/CHANGEME/My-Repo/zips</datadir>            <------------change the CHANGEME
	</extension>
	<extension point="xbmc.addon.metadata">
		<summary>Install MY Addons</summary>
		<description>Download and install addons from HELLO.......For OFFICIAL !! Support Visit XBMCHUB.COM</description>
		<platform>all</platform>
	</extension>
</addon>


"
ONCE YOU HAVE CHANGED EVERYTHING YOU WILL NEED TO ZIP UP THE "repository.YourRepo" and name it  "repository.YourRepo-1.0.zip"

and put it in correct folder inside the zips folder , the number "-1.0" represents the version number that is in any addon.xml


obviously you will have to do that with your plugin too !!!!


when you have folderised and zipped everything YOU CAN RUN THE ADDONS_XML_GENERATOR.PY


THAT WILL CHANGE THE MAIN ADDONS.XML TELLING XBMC WHERE TO LOOK AND WHAT VERSION NUMBER OF YOUR PLUGIN IS 

PLUS IT WILL CHANGE THE addons.xml.MD5 so xbmc knows there is a new version of your plugin




so i have setup a standard repo so people can use or create there own on there drop box

 what you need to do is download this zip

 and extract it in your public folder in your dropbox

 so your directory will look like this

 DropBox/Public/My-Repo/

 there is a readme.txt included 

 obviously you will need to do simple editing of some files which is all in the readme

 GOOD LUCK!!!!

 as of october 2011 dropbox has stopped public folder but there is a way around it

create a Public Folder with a capital "P"

 open a new tab

 then go to this url

https://www.dropbox.com/enable_public_folder

 NOTE: to get your public number you need to download the software put something in you public folder locally and right click on it and click on "Get public Link"

 youll see your number there
